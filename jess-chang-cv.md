Jess Hsiu-Ju Chang is a PhD Candidate engaged in interdisciplinary research within the Design, Data and Society Group and the Building Ideology Group, at TU Delft. Her work is focused on the dynamic interplay between contemporary social and environmental issues, such as care, digital advancements, data, gender, politics, and their extensive impact on spatial environments at various scales. Her current research conceptualises healthcare architecture as the work environment of nursing caregivers and explores the shifting synergy between technology, nursing practice and the projected spatial production over time. Situated in the Dutch maternity care environments, her work explores the unique practices and its spatial implication, cultural connotation and labour conditions. Her other on-going projects include the study of the historical community care centre Cross buildings (Kruisgebouwen) in the postwar Netherlands; exploring architectural feature of Cross buildings through history of infectious diseases; and developing computer-aided methods in historical studies.
