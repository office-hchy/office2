# ＨＣＨＹ

/
HCHY is a design studio for architecture that explores visual medium and digital tools that affect the formation of spaces.

To achieve this, we create 3D models, scan spaces, and make videos in parellel to traditional architecture design process. The end result can manifest the diversity and complexity of architecture in relation to the city and its residents. We are triggered by how media and technology transforms the way people understand and interact with architecture.

HCHY was founded in 2019 in Taichung, [TW]. Its main members have years of experience as architects, designers, visualiers in Taiwan and the Netherlands.
