# ＨＣＨＹ

HCHY was founded by [Heng Yu](/hengyu) and [Jess Hsiu-Ju Chang](hjchang) in 2019. Based in Taichung, Taiwan, HCHY’s design works have span across Taiwan and the Netherlands. HCHY explores the infinite possibilities within the contemporary spatial morphology, expounding how visual medium and digital tool affect the production of spaces.

The main services span various scales of imagery production, including:

- Competition 3D animations
- Still image renderings
- Spatial analysis and animated diagrams
- Image post-production
